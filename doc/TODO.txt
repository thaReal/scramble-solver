B1 - "Qu" doesn't work with solver logic/input checks.

B2 - MonkeyRunner "ChimpChat" Errors
	 > Occasionally monkeyrunner will launch and throw a ton of 'chimpchat'
	 errors when trying to send input to the device. Originally I thought it 
	 occured if monkeyrunner didn't exit cleanly but that doesn't seem to be
	 the case. Need to look into error handling directly with 
	 monkeyrunner/jython since I'm not sure if it's possible for python to know
	 whether an input command was succesful or not.
	 
B3 - 'z' in a corner 

Improvements
------------

I1 - Ultimately want to improve overall start-to-finish workflow time to run 
	 the app as much as possible to eventually implement a "tournament mode". I
	 know it can be done easily in the lower rounds but I think it's going to 
	 take some asynchronous events and potentinally multiple threads.
	 
I2 - Use MonkeyDevice.drag() vs. device.touch() 

I3 - Calculate actual speed (per word of a given size) that program runs at to 
	 use as a baseline for determining bottlenecks.
