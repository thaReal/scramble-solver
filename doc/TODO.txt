B1 - "Qu" doesn't work with solver logic/input checks.

B2 - MonkeyRunner "ChimpChat" Errors
	 > Occasionally monkeyrunner will launch and throw a ton of 'chimpchat'
	 errors when trying to send input to the device. Originally I thought it 
	 occured if monkeyrunner didn't exit cleanly but that doesn't seem to be
	 the case. Need to look into error handling directly with 
	 monkeyrunner/jython since I'm not sure if it's possible for python to know
	 whether an input command was succesful or not.
