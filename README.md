Zynga Scramble Solver Bot
=========================
Still an early, experimental version but with everything configured correctly
(see below) the bot works fairly well and should manage to hit about 90% - 98% 
of the possible words during a regular game. 

| Warning: Still Under Construction |


Basic Instructions
------------------
All control is [for the moment] being handled by 'appmanager.py'. For a regular game, get to the matchup screen and then run appmanager with no arguments. For 
tournament mode, run 'appmanager.py -t'. 

Additional funtionality is being added and well eventually be rolled into an 
optparse interface.


Dependencies / Running
